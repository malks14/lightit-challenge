- **Endpoint**: `/users`
- **Methods**: GET

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)

## Design Decisions & Architecture

### Layout & Navigation
- **Fixed Navigation**: The search filter is positioned at the top and remains fixed during scrolling, ensuring users can always access search functionality without scrolling back to the top. This improves user experience when dealing with large patient lists.

### Patient Cards Design
- **Minimal Information Display**: Cards show only essential information (name, basic description) to allow quick patient recognition without overwhelming the interface.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: The "View more" CTA reveals additional patient details (website, ID, creation date) when needed, maintaining a clean initial view while providing access to complete information.
- **Ellipsis Menu**: Implemented a three-dot menu in the top-right corner of each card, following established UI patterns that users are already familiar with from other applications.

### Component Architecture

#### Reusable Components
- **DropdownMenu**: Created as a reusable component that can be used across the application. Functions are passed as props, making it flexible for different use cases without code duplication.
- **ReusableModal & Backdrop**: Centralized modal management with consistent z-index handling. Changes to modal behavior only need to be made in one place, ensuring consistency across the application.
- **Unified Form Component**: Single `PatientForm` component handles both creating and editing patients since they require the same data fields. The component adapts its behavior based on whether a `patient` prop is provided.

#### Layout System
- **Flexbox over CSS Grid**: Chose Flexbox for the patient cards layout because cards are expandable. CSS Grid would force all cards in the same row to match the height of the tallest card, creating unwanted blank space when some cards are expanded and others are not.

### State Management
- **React Context API**: Implemented `PatientsContext` for centralized state management with two key benefits:
  1. **Single Source of Truth**: All patient data is managed in one place, preventing inconsistencies
  2. **Cross-Component Access**: State can be easily accessed by any component in the application without prop drilling

### UI Libraries & Tools
- **Radix UI**: Used exclusively for toast notifications (`@radix-ui/react-toast`). This choice provides accessible, well-tested toast functionality without adding unnecessary UI library dependencies.
- **Custom Components**: Built all other UI components from scratch to maintain full control over styling and behavior, ensuring they perfectly match the application's design requirements.

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better developer experience
- **ESLint**: Enforces coding standards and catches potential issues
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting across the project
- **FontAwesome**: Provides consistent, professional icons throughout the application
